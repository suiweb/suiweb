# SuiWeb - An Educational Web Framework (Inspired by React)

## Yet Another Web Framework? 🙄

SuiWeb is an educational web framework with the goal to introduce the most important concepts of modern web frameworks, especially [React](https://reactjs.org/), and explain how they work internally in an easy-to-understand way. The API provided by SuiWeb is heavily inspired by React's, so if you are already familiar with React, you most probably already know how to use most of the functions provided by SuiWeb.


## Goals 🥅

SuiWeb is not meant to be used to develop real applications, as it's not optimized for performance. This is intentional, as optimizing performance would increase the complexity. The goal of this framework is to keep things as easy simple as possible, focusing on the essential parts of some important concepts.


## General Information 💡

SuiWeb was created as a project work at the [ZHAW School of Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/) by [Timo Siegenthaler](https://github.com/triumphvalley) and [Simon Schuhmacher](https://github.com/simonschuhmacher), and supervised by [Dr. Gerrit Burkert](https://github.com/gburkert). The project is based on an earlier implementation (SuiWeb 0.3.3) by Dr. Gerrit Burkert, that was used as part of the web development module of the computer science bachelor curriculum at ZHAW. The project is inspired by Rodrigo Pombo's [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).

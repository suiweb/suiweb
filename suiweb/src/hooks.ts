/**
 * The function `useEffect` can be used in a functional component to execute an action,

 * @param action - The action to execute after rendering the component.
 * @param dependencies - Defines the dependencies that decide on execution of `action`.
 * `action` will only be called if any of the value in the dependencies has changed
 * since the last render of the component.
 * Pass an empty array (`[]`) to only run `action` on the first render.
 * Pass `undefined` (or leave away the parameter) to run `action` on every render.
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const Counter = () => {
 *     const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 *
 *     // `action` is called after every render.
 *     useEffect(() => console.log('Counter changed.')) // no dependencies defined
 *
 *     // `action` is called after every render, if the value of `count`
 *     // changed since the last render.
 *     useEffect(() => console.log('Counter changed.'), [count]) // specific dependency defined
 *
 *     // `action` is called only after the first render.
 *     useEffect(() => console.log('Counter changed.'), []) // empty array dependency

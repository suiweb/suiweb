# SuiWeb - An Educational Web Framework (Inspired by React)

SuiWeb is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and bundled using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Execute `npm run dev` in your terminal to create a development build with a local web server that supports hot reloading. To create a distribution build, execute `npm run build`, which produces both a minified build and one that just transpiles the TypeScript source code into JavaScript but retains the original module structure of the framework.

To start using SuiWeb, have a look at the [getting started guide](../getting-started.md).

# SuiWeb


## Yet Another Web Framework? ðŸ™„

SuiWeb is an educative web framework with the goal to introduce the most important concepts of modern web frameworks, especially [React](https://reactjs.org/), and explain how they work internally in an easy-to-understand way. The API provided by SuiWeb is heavily inspired by React's, so if you are already familiar with React, you most probably already know how to use most of the functions provided by SuiWeb.


## Goals ðŸ¥…

SuiWeb is not meant to be used to develop real applications, as it's not optimized for performance. This is intentional, as optimizing performance would increase the complexity. The goal of this framework is to keep things as easy simple as possible, focusing on the essential parts of some important concepts. If you are interested in the concepts on how React optimizes performance by scheduling updates, you might be interested in the tutorial [Build your own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) by [Rodrigo Pombo](https://pomb.us/), which focuses on aspects like the work loop, that are also important concepts of React, but are not covered in this framework. 

If you are looking for a framework to build a real application, have a look at proven standards, like [React](https://reactjs.org/). After working through the tutorial of SuiWeb, you might actually easily transition over to React, as most of SuiWeb's API is available in React as well (and a lot more, of course).


## Getting Started ðŸš€

Now, you might want to have a look at how you can [get started](/docs/getting-started) with SuiWeb, look at its [API documentation](/docs/api), work through the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial) explaining the internal concepts of SuiWeb or just have a look at the [demos](/docs/demos).

# Tutorial

The following tutorial helps you to understand the concepts of SuiWeb.

It is divided into multiple levels. Start with the first level and continue as you complete the other levels. This helps you to first focus on the things that are easier to understand and needed in order to understand more difficult concepts.

It's recommended that you have a running local setup of SuiWeb for going through the tutorial. If you have not yet set up your local environment, consider having a look at the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide.

Once you're ready, let's get started with the [first level](1-static-rendering/README.md)! ðŸš€

# Overview

Welcome to the documentation of SuiWeb. In the following pages, you can find both the [API documentation](api/README.md) of SuiWeb, and a [tutorial](tutorial/README.md), which guides you step by step through the source code of SuiWeb to help you understand the concepts that power this framework, as well as React. 

We gave our best to find a nice balance between keeping things simple, so the concepts can easily be understood, but still including everything we think is absolutely essential to understand the basics of modern web frameworks, like React.

With that, let's start by [setting up your first project](getting-started.md) with SuiWeb, so you are ready to play around with it and explore its functionality while going through this documentation. If you just want to look at the functionality of the framework, you might be interested in the [demos](demos.md).
